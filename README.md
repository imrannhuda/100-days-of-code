# Welcome to my logbook for the 100 Days of Code challenge

I have decided to participate in the #100DaysOfCode challenge on Twitter to make my developer's journey fun and connect with other developers. This logbook records my daily progress and I update it at the end of each day.

I am following my own unwritten guidelines to make the challenge more suitable for me and as such, this fork has been heavily edited from the official repository.

Feel free to fork my repository if you want the simplicity and flexibility, or check out the [official repository](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code) or the [official website](http://100daysofcode.com/).
